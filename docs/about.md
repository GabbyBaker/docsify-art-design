# Why 'Amen'?

Generally when we hear "amen," it is in response to prayer or other worshipful thought that we agree with. The word has come to mean "so be it" or "let it be even according to your word" (in King James vernacular). It is a powerful expression that joins our agreement to a spiritual idea, thus expanding the weight and reality of that idea in our hearts through faith. "Again," Jesus said, "I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 18:19).

But like many words in Hebrew, the word comes with many derivatives that sound quite alike but are used quite differently then you might expect. One of those is **craftsman** or **artist**.

## How did we go from prayer to craftsman?

Let's back up slightly. According to Abarim Publications, 

> The word *amen* comes from the verb אמן (*'aman*), which reflects **certainty**... 
>
> The verb אמן (*'aman*) means **to affirm or support**. The familiar adverb אמן (*'amen*), its lesser known feminine version אמנה (*'omna*) and the plural variant אמנם (*'umnam*) mean **verily or truly**.

When we say "amen" in church, we are acknowledging that the word of God is **true**, **certain**, and **reliable**. What does this have to do with craftmanship?

The dictionary definition from Abarim Publications goes on to say that

> The masculine noun אמן (*'omman*), denoting a skilled or "true" worker; someone who either is well established, has a lot of experience, or can be **trusted** to do an excellent job (Exodus 28:11 and Song of Solomon 7:1 only).

A good craftsman, a good artist, is reliable and "can be trusted to do an excellent job." This does not only apply if the craft is stone masonry, carpentry, or tentmaking. The Greek word *tekton*, found in Matthew 13:55 and Mark 6:3, also means craftsman and includes a wide range of artisan skills:

* a woodworker
* a songwriter
* a poet
* an author
* an architect or planner
* any craftsman or workman

Adapted from *Thayer and Smith. "Greek Lexicon entry for Tekton". "[The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon](http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/kjv/)".*

## What does your art say?

Does your art say "amen"? When you create, does it affirm the Word of God and the truth about His character? Do others read the gospel in your illustrations, your novel, your photography, your film, your 3-D model, your music?

With a worldview like this, it is important that we raise our standards of craftsmanship so that we can more fully communicate the glory of God to the world. Our work must be reliable, excellent, and mostly importantly, **true**. 

We chose the name "Amen!" for this series  of courses because we want to teach others how to affirm gospel truth through art and do so with the highest craft we can attain to -- not for our own glory, but for the glory of God.
