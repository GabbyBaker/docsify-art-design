We have already learned some terms for the digital space, such as application, operating system, software versus hardware, and file extensions.

But there are some terms that actually borrow from real life. The computer **file system** is one of them: it is based on how files are organized in filing cabinets in office (and some home) settings.



> **Fast Fact**: Nearly all companies are required to maintain paper copies of important documents for a set number of years before they can be thrown away. Digital file storage serves as a backup in case of natural disaster and an easier way to find a file in day to day use.



Below are some recommended mini-lessons on computer basics so that you can understand the computer file system. But remember: This is your learning path. So if there is any other topic that interests you and you want to learn more, go for it! Just pace yourself so you don't get overwhelmed.

Before search indexing was powerful (thanks to Google), file systems were critical for keeping track of documents on computers. It was the only way!

Reflect on the two approaches to file organization presented in the article: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Which do you think would be more effective for a digital artist like yourself?
