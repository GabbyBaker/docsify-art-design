# Exploring the Krita Program

*Wait! Did I miss the step on how to connect a drawing tablet?*



Good catch! In order to do that step, you will need to get more familiar with the app itself. 

For this leg of the path, there are two goals:

- [ ] Connect a drawing tablet to Krita
- [ ] Go on an application tour



## Go on an application tour

Open up your freshly installed Krita application, and getting started with the video below.

### Bonus Tip: What is the best resolution for digital art?

Sara Tepes and [Corrine Hadway](https://www.celticcocopublishingllc.com/about-corinne) of Blade and Quill each use different PPI (pixels per inch) settings when creating a new canvas in Krita. How do you know what the best resolution is? What does **resolution** even *mean*? Find out with digital artist Aaron Rutten:

### Using the Tablet with Krita

You may remember from the ["Getting Into Digital Art" learning path](course02-digital-intro/home.md) that a drawing tablet is a tool that you can (and should!) use to make drawing on a computer easier. However, you can't just plug it into your computer and expect it to work. Each application, including Krita, requires a different setup to link the tablet to the application tools.
