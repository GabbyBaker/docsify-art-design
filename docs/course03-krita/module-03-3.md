Remember our good friend, the file extension? This is where he comes in.



When we go to export and save in Krita (or any other digital art application), we have numerous file extension options to choose from. What do all the letters mean? Does it matter what format you save it in? As a digital artist, you need to understand image file types so that you can preserve your art (both traditional art that is scanned and digital art made on a computer).
