# Preparing Your Workspace

To learn how to become a digital artist with Krita, we first need to get a copy onto our own computer and connect a drawing tablet. (To understand why these are important tools for digital artists, consider exploring the ["Getting Into Digital Art" learning path](course02-digital-intro/home.md).)

For this leg of the path, there are three goals:

- [ ]  Get familiar with your computer
- [ ]  Download Krita onto your computer
- [ ]  Connect a drawing tablet to Krita



If you feel like you are already comfortable with how computers work and how to download new apps, then skip the next section and go straight to "Meet Krita".
