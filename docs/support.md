A friend and former student once described me as that mentor character in books and movies, and I've discovered that I do love to help people navigate the forest of life. 

To me, learning is an expression of life -- what we were made to do -- and thus a journey in itself. In the words of Charlotte Mason, "Education is a life." I help people find the beaten path in the yellow wood, harnessing videos, articles, and a bit of my own teaching experience into easy to follow learning paths so that they can master unfamiliar topics and enjoy doing it.

Most importantly, being a Christian informs my worldview about how we learn, why we learn, and what we learn. (Hint: It's so we can find fulfillment as a mirror of God's character and share that with ~~others~~ the universe.) So every course I develop is designed to help the learner apply that worldview to their craft.

This series of courses on art and design were a love gift for a friend; but if you are inspired or blessed by the content, then think about supporting my journey as a pathwright.
