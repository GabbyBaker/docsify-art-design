# Welcome to GIVING GLORY

This path is designed to get you thinking about the "heart" side of art and how being an artist intersects with discipleship and the great controversy. To get a quick overview of what will be covered or how long it might take, check out the course schedule. 

Remember: **This is your learning path.** Do it at your pace -- fast, slow, or in between -- but do it consistently. Many modules will include more than one type of resource (an article, a short video, a long video). Choose a single resource or use a combination to build your understanding. It's up to you. These are *tools* for you, not required homework. 

The most important thing is that you practice the theory as you go. Head + hands + heart = effective disciple artists. Dare to try and grow along the way!
