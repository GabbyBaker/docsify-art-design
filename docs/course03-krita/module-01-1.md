Digital spaces, just like their analog counterparts, have unique words we use to describe simple objects or processes. Most tutorials online for digital products will use these terms without hesitation; but it can be a lot to take in if you are not already familiar with these terms. That's what this step in the journey is for!

Below are some recommended mini-lessons on computer basics so that you can comfortably get started with Krita. But remember: This is your learning path. So if there is any other topic that interests you and you want to learn more, go for it! Just pace yourself so you don't get overwhelmed.
