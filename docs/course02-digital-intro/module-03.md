# Which is better: digital art or traditional art?

Over the last 50 to 60 years since the introduction of digital art, there have been huge debates:



> * Can we actually call computer-generated illustrations "art"?
> * If it is art, is it better than traditional, or is it a cheap substitute?
> * Which one should we encourage new artists to pursue? Which one will stand the test of time?



To begin your evaluation of this debate, think about some of the assumptions and biases that you hold about...

* ...what art is
* ...the role of technology in human life
* ...the reasons why we create art
* ...careers and economic trends
* ...what you are capable of learning and being



That's a lot! But these are the many facets of opinions that affect how we think about the contest between traditional and digital art. What it comes down to is this: **If I already enjoy making art with traditional mediums, why should I bother with digital art? And if I don't do art at all right now, why should I start on the computer?**
