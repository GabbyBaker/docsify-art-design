# Preparing Your Workspace

To learn how to become a digital artist with Krita, we first need to get a copy onto our own computer and connect a drawing tablet. (To understand why these are important tools for digital artists, consider exploring the ["Getting Into Digital Art" learning path](course02-digital-intro/home.md).)

For this leg of the path, there are three goals:

- [ ]  Get familiar with your computer
- [ ]  Download Krita onto your computer
- [ ]  Connect a drawing tablet to Krita



If you feel like you are already comfortable with how computers work and how to download new apps, then skip the next section and go straight to "Meet Krita".

## Meet Your Computer

**Krita** is a computer software that enables artists to create paintings and illustrations digitally. 

Digital spaces, just like their analog counterparts, have unique words we use to describe simple objects or processes. Most tutorials online for digital products will use these terms without hesitation; but it can be a lot to take in if you are not already familiar with these terms. That's what this step in the journey is for!

Below are some recommended mini-lessons on computer basics so that you can comfortably get started with Krita. But remember: This is your learning path. So if there is any other topic that interests you and you want to learn more, go for it! Just pace yourself so you don't get overwhelmed.
