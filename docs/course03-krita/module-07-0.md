# The World Is Your Oyster

*Create something beautiful.* 

___

This is the time when you pause from *learning* new skills and work on *developing* new skills.



It's your turn to create.



At this point in your learning path, it is easy to think that you don't know enough to "create" anything. That's not true! The truth is that you will always feel like your skills aren't quite good enough because you will know that there is more to learn. Part of being a lifelong learning is accepting what you don't know but being proud of what you do.

After watching a [video on Sara Tepes' digital painting process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMHJFdgRjYk&t=123s) , one YouTube commenter wrote:

> "***I want to see it be more socially acceptable to be visibly proud of your accomplishments.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I appreciate people who take the time and effort to not only study a skill, but to take a step back and recognize the great extent of what they have achieved. It is more motivating for me, too.***"

Feeling confident and inspired? Jump into Krita and start playing around. Choose a small goal (I want to draw a cat, tree, girl) and see how you do. Or try a few contour style drawings to help you get started.



If you need a little bit more direction (or more help), use the video guides below. Remember: This is your learning path. Choose the guides you need, pass over the ones you don't, and take the trail as slow or as fast as you want.



For this leg of the path, you have one goal:

- [ ]  Get used to drawing on a drawing tablet.
- [ ]  Feel comfortable creating in Krita.
