# What is digital art and where do I begin?

___

## The World Wide Web

One of the fascinating gifts of the internet is the ability to meet people across the globe who share your interests. Online you will find scores of artists, both those who use traditional mediums and those who use digital technology; and certainly, you will find someone whose style you appreciate and can learn from.

Throughout this and other courses on this site, you will be introduced to some of these digital artists. Many of them have a YouTube channel where they share tips about software or showcase their art process. Others do this through a traditional web blog, sharing primarily in text and images. Some received professional art training at the high school or college level, while others were self-taught.

One of these artists, [Sofie van Nierop](https://sofiedoesart.com/about/), has put together a beginners guide to digital art. She is largely self-taught, so she's coming from a background where everything was once new and unfamiliar to her. Now she makes art like this!

## First Steps

Take a few minutes to read Sofie's blog post about getting started with digital art. ([Go there now.](https://sofiedoesart.com/getting-started-with-digital-art/))



> How closely did your ideas about digital art line up with what Sofie shared? What was the same? What was different? 
>
> Does it seem easier or harder than you thought (or a mix of both)? Why?



*(Sofie also has a great article on [how to write meaningful comments](https://sofiedoesart.com/tips-writing-meaningful-comments/) on blog posts and YouTube videos. Try writing a comment on her digital art post!)*



Another amazing digital artist is [Brad Colbow](http://brad.site). He focuses primarily on comic-style art, and he is building a free art academy on YouTube. He recently (September 2022) published two videos about getting started with creating art digitally. The most important question for any artist is, **What tools will I need?** If it's not graphite, canvas, or charcoal, then what will I use?

You will revisit Brad and watch the second part to this mini series in the final module of this course. 

But now that you know the basics, let's step into the actually experience of digital art creation.
