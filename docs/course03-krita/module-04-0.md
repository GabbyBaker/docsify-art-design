# Using Layers and Masks (part 1)

> There isn’t a perfect definition for a layer but in simple terms, it can be described as **a level on which you can place an image or graphic.** Layers, can also be defined as **stacks of different levels for the placement of graphics to put together a digital artwork**. [Layers] are important to any design workflow since they are used to work on individual parts of an image *while not affecting other parts.* They allow you to modify your image, add text, change colors, put two pictures on the same page, and more without modifying your original photo.

For this leg of the path, you have four goals:

- [ ]  Get familiar with your computer's file system
- [ ]  Learn to save new files and open existing ones in Krita
- [ ]  Learn to correct errors in Krita
- [ ]  Develop a file organization system for your digital art



## Why Use Layers?

When we create illustrations on paper or other physical medium, every change, stroke, or color goes right on top of the things beneath in. But this means that when we look back at the completed project, we have no idea which change happened second or fourth, and we have no way of modifying a single change without affecting other aspects of the art.

In the digital world, this loss of information and control is <u>tragic</u>.

For digital work, it is important to use version control and **nondestructive editing**. How we save and organize our files helps us keep track of version control; using layers and masks helps us edit nondestructively.



Read one or both of the articles below to get a better understanding of how layers work and why they are important in digital art.
