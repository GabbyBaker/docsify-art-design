# Working with Files

To learn how to become a digital artist with Krita, we first need to get a copy onto our own computer and connect a drawing tablet. (To understand why these are important tools for digital artists, consider exploring the ["Getting Into Digital Art" learning path](course02-digital-intro/home.md).)

For this leg of the path, you have five goals:

- [ ]  Get familiar with your computer's file system
- [ ]  Learn to save new files and open existing ones in Krita
- [ ]  Learn to correct errors in Krita
- [ ]  Develop a file organization system for your digital art
- [ ]  Understand image file types and know how to choose the best one for your projects



If you feel like you are already comfortable with how computers work and navigate the File Explorer, then skip the next section and go straight to "Meet Krita".

## Computer File System

We have already learned some terms for the digital space, such as application, operating system, software versus hardware, and file extensions.

But there are some terms that actually borrow from real life. The computer **file system** is one of them: it is based on how files are organized in filing cabinets in office (and some home) settings.



> **Fast Fact**: Nearly all companies are required to maintain paper copies of important documents for a set number of years before they can be thrown away. Digital file storage serves as a backup in case of natural disaster and an easier way to find a file in day to day use.



Below are some recommended mini-lessons on computer basics so that you can understand the computer file system. But remember: This is your learning path. So if there is any other topic that interests you and you want to learn more, go for it! Just pace yourself so you don't get overwhelmed.

### What do you think?

Before search indexing was powerful (thanks to Google), file systems were critical for keeping track of documents on computers. It was the only way!

Today, this is no longer the case. **[Read this article](https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z)**. Reflect on the two approaches to file organization presented in the article: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Which do you think would be more effective for a digital artist like yourself?

## Choosing the Right File Type

Remember our good friend, the file extension? This is where he comes in.



When we go to export and save in Krita (or any other digital art application), we have numerous file extension options to choose from. What do all the letters mean? Does it matter what format you save it in? As a digital artist, you need to understand image file types so that you can preserve your art (both traditional art that is scanned and digital art made on a computer).
